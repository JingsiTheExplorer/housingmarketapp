A high sale-to-list price ratio, where sales prices are close to or exceed the list prices, indicates a sellerâ€™s market. This scenario suggests strong demand and competitive buying conditions.
Conversely, a lower ratio, where sales prices are significantly below list prices, points to a buyer's market, indicating weaker demand or an oversupply of properties.""")

A short DOM typically signals a strong seller's market with high demand and quick sales, prompting sellers to price aggressively and buyers to act swiftly to secure properties. Conversely, a long DOM suggests a buyer's market, potentially allowing buyers to negotiate lower prices due to reduced demand or seller urgency. ")
